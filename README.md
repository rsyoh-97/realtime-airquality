# realtime-airquality

This Python script calls the API to fetch real-time air quality index information from the Real-time Air Quality Index website (https://aqicn.org/). 
Currently the script calls for data in json on Seoul, South Korea. It then saves the data in an outfile (which uses the name of the city, so Seoul in this case) in the same directory.
